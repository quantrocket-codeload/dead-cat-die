    "\n",
    "Moonshot strategy that shorts stocks that fell 10% or more the previous day. Despite the proverbial idea of the \"dead cat bounce,\" this strategy exploits the tendency of stocks that suffer large one-day losses to keep falling the next day.\n",

Note that the US market is excluded due to SEC Rule 201 (Alternative Uptick Rule), which restricts short-selling of stocks that fall by 10% or more. \n",
